\section{Intellectual Capture}

The debate tournament's potential for intellectual capture is under-appreciated. If appreciated, I shan't be suprised to see interested parties funding their own debate tournaments for ideological purposes.

The problem with the British Parliamentary format is not that it is open to intellectual capture. Its malaise is that (1) in theory, it is entirely captured by the core adjudicators and the body of judge, and (2) in practice, it is entirely captured by youthful idealism, which is naturally prone to levitate from reality, for there is no mechanical temperance by reality. 

All forms of competitive or performative debate are open to intellectual and ideological capture. The Roman Senatorial Debate is no exception - but it is more prone to intellectual capture by ideologies informed by interest, and stakeholderhood. 


How can the Roman Senatorial Debate be used to capture the intellectuals?
