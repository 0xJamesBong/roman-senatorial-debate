It is very likely that this set of rules will yield emergent phenomena. It is my sincere hope that the game, along with its emergent phenomena, will beget and engender virtues in its particpants: honour, intellectualism, honesty, duty, and most importantly, the prudent and intelligent use of force. The pen that is dancing is only as mighty as the sword that is at rest.


\subsection{Bribery}

Consider the case where in the first round of votes, the vote distribution is 7 Y and 1 N. This is a highly stable state. The 7 participants have no incentive to switch their vote. Anybody switching would be giving up 3 points for at best 1 point, and the jackpot sum that's already in the bag. 

Then, what's the point of the debate here? There is no point. There would only be a point to debate if there's a destablizing force of some sort. 

If things have been left to their own devices, then the inevitable solution will emerge by itself - bribery, vote-buying.  

Vote-buying, from other senators, and only from other senators, serves as a reasonable destablizing force. 

If the form of vote-buying enabled involves the inflation of the supply of votes, then debate will become a simple matter of money takes all. This is not a good thing. Vote inflation must not be allowed. It destroys the need to debate, the need to persuade, and the need to offer a bribe. It eliminates politicking and favour-trading - which is the whole point of this exercise. But if vote-buying is restricted to the form of bribing other senators, then there will still be a tug of war between conscience and monetary self-interest. 


Since we are dealing with actual money, vote-buying is going to be particularly impactful on less well-off participants. This naturally means there would be a natural incentive for poor participants to join the tournament - for the promise of monetary prises. Just like how the poker game inevitably attracts the poor university student.


One might wonder, does one need to introduce a mechanism to enforce the promises of bribery? The answer is no. In fact, it absolutely should not be introduced. For if you do, then it eliminates the possibility of creating the culture of honour and promisekeeping. Furthermore, dishonest and lying bribe-offerers will likely be punished as the tournament progresses. Reiterated game theory dynamic secures it. If you cheated someone of a promised bribe, what are the chances you will maintain your standing in the tournament? Or in another tournament? 

On the other hand, perhaps there is someone you really want to screw over - either because of personal vendetta or because of the repugnance of their views. In these case, one might be highly motivated to engage in treachery.

The capacity for treachery is something we should cultivate—even if its victims find it distasteful. Participants must internalize this, not only because treachery is an unavoidable feature of life, especially in high politics, but also because those with lofty ideals and ambitions will find it a dagger they cannot do without. If our goal is to foster a culture of trust and honour, as well as the capacity to betray and wound—like the Roman senators of old—then we must give participants the space to exercise both. Most importantly, the point is that a man is good not because he is weak and is unable to inflict pain, but because he is strong and is able to do harm, but choses not to do so. Si vis pacem, para bellum.


It is therefore no overstatement to say that bribery is the mother of honour in this game. 


This begets an interesting question: why are bribes so frowned upon in modern electoral arena? 

The most promising answer is that not all bribes are identical. The follow-up is that favour-trading is the equivalent of bribes that we described and enabled in our debate game - and that is never disallowed. Indeed, favour-trading is what politics is all about. If disallowed, politics disintegrates and ceases to be. 


But that is indeed a rather simplistic answer. Let's pin down a particular form of vote-buying. It seems particularly intuitive why enabling the buying of votes in parliament is not a good idea - it should seem too powerful a mechanism to reorganize interests - it's like staring directly into the sun. 

But how about the case of vote-buying from the general voter? Why can't the ordinary voter sell his vote? 


Bribing parliamentarians enable embezzlement or cronyism - specifically the case of transferring funds to a service provider whose service is purchased by the government. The parliamentary receives a bribe, either directly, or in the form of a kickback.

The key mechanism is that the parliamentarian increased the price the government is willing to pay for the service than the government would have paid if there was no bribe. The difference is then split between the service-provider and the bribe paid to the parliamentarian.

Does this mechanism manifest if ordinary voters are bribed? One might argue it is less likely as the parliamentarian is still

So I think it's safe to say that the case where bribery is enabled for the general voter is more resistant to embezzlement than bribes for parliamentarians. \footnote{Hi}
