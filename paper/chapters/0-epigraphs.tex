\epigraph{The parliament passes some acts or decree which may have the most devastating consequences, yet nobody bears the responsibility for it. Nobody can be called to account. For surely one cannot say that a Cabinet discharges its responsibility when it retires after having brought about a catastrophe.

Can the principle of responsibility mean anything else than the responsibility of a definite person?}{---Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf} &

\epigraph{The British Parliament is like a curious old clock: its hands move, but no one quite knows why.}{---Aneurin Bevan (paraphrased)} \\
